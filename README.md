# Generate Tiles
This repository is to pratice adding generated tiles to a map. I used a light_all map from [CartoDB map][] as the base and collected tiles from the QGIS QuickMapService Plugin *Google Satellite* in and around Oregon State Campus. These tiles are located in the assests file. When the viewer is in the zoom of 14 to 18 the viewer will see some overlaying satellite imageries of the OSU campus.
